# Author: Ryan Rosiak
<br /><br />
## Requirements:
* Need Spring framework jar files and some Java api jar files
* Need Tomcat 9 Server set up to run files
<br /><br />
## Overview:
This repo consists of programs and projects that I have written while learning the Spring framework. Some key topics that are being learned are Spring MVC, Boot, REST, Maven, 
and Core. There is also a tie in with Hibernate and MySQL. These projects will serve as a foundation for my fundamental understanding of the Spring framework.
